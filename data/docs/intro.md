# Introduction

Welcome to the DocsGPT Example API.

This API allows developers to interact with a fictional service that processes user data, performs analysis, and returns results through simple HTTP requests.

The API is designed to be easy to use and follows standard REST principles:
- All requests use HTTPS.
- Responses are returned in JSON format.
- Errors are indicated using standard HTTP status codes.

Common endpoints include:
- `/analyze`: Submit data for processing.
- `/status`: Retrieve the current status of a submitted job.
- `/results`: Fetch the results of a completed analysis.

Before using the API, make sure you have your API key and authentication details ready.
